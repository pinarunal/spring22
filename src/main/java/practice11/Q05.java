     Step 1 : Create an ArrayList containing the days.
     Step 2 : Create an ArrayList to which we will add the daily earnings.
     Step 3 : With the while loop, take the 7-day earnings from the user one by one and add them to the daily earnings ArrayList.
     Step 4 : Get the average earnings with the method called averageOfEarnings().
     Step 5 : Create a method called daysAboveAverage().
              Compare all days with average earnings with for loop
              If higher than average earnings, return those days.
     Step 6 : Create a method called daysBelowAverage().
              Compare all days with average earnings with for loop
              If less than average earnings, return those days.
