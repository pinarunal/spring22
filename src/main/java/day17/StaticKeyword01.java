        Question 1: How do you use non-static things inside the "main" method?
                    There are 2 ways;
                    i)Make it static
                    ii)Create an object then by the help of the object
                       use it in "main" method
        Question 2: How do you access to static and non-static things from outside the class?
                    i)Just Class Name is enough to access static things
                    ii)You have to create object to access non-static things
