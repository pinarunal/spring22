1)Every variable is "public", "static" and "final" in interfaces
2)If you want to type "public", "static" and "final" explicitly to make your cade more readable you can do it.
3)Final variables must be initialized because of that every variable must be initialized  in interfaces.
4)If you have some variables whose signatures are same in parent interfaces, when you call them you
 have to declare the name of the interface otherwise it will give compile time error.
